Compiling with Gulp and Elixir

A stripped down version of Jeffrey Ways Elixir, nothing too clever from my part, just a clone of laravel 5.3 with all the Laravel bits removed.

I love Laravel and use it avlot for apps, but when creating a website that loads faster, 
I needed to use the awesome compiler that Jeffrey made without using the Laravel framework.

It is great to use and I hope you get some use out of it as I have, 
see the laravel compile dos for how to use effectively, if you like the compiler you will love Laravel.
